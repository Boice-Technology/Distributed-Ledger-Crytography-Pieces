Important Guidelines to be maintained and followed:

1.) Every usecase folder should consist of sources related to that particular concept or implementation, like for instance, a research paper link or youtube video link.
2.) A code file should consist of only one function(exceptions two or three) depending upon function's significance to be included in a file.
3.) A code file name should be intuitive, descriptive and CamelCase.
4.) Codes related to one usecase must be organised in Go packages.
